v 2.0:
	-VAST internal improvements.
	-Improved animations.
	-Changed the click sound.
	-General audio improvements.
	-You now see what a cube contributed to your health or score when it falls off the screen.
	It's shown by a +{Insert Value} at the bottom of the screen at the same horizontal position
	the cube had when it fell off the bottom of the screen.
	-Changed the size of some UI elements.
	-Changed the game's font to something more fun.
	-Changed some menus' layouts.
	-Added a combo counter (and it's really fancy).
		-Touching green, blue, and special cubes progresses your combo, while touching ANY red cubes (yes,
		even bombs), ends your combo, and gives you some feedback based on how far you got in your combo. 
	-The Pause button has been changed. You can no longer pause the game by tapping the screen with three fingers.
	Instead, press the Menu button on your phone.
	-You can now close the app by pressing your phone's back button. Be cautious, though! This will not suspend the
	app, it will end it. It will still show up if you hold your Home key, but clicking on it from there will put
	you back at the intro. You'll lose all unsaved data. Also, 
	
	VERY IMPORTANT, IF YOU READ NOTHING ELSE, READ THIS: DO NOT press your phone's back button in the moments after
	the game over screen appears, or after clicking the Main Menu button in the Pause screen. These are times when
	the game now saves your Highscore data. Your data could become corrupt and unusable if you close the app at one
	of these points, which means you would have to uninstall the app and reinstall it. It doesn't take long to save,
	just don't go tapping the back button like crazy immediately in the aforementioned situations.

	-Speaking of that, you can now save your highscore without having to lose the current round. Just pause the game
	and return to the main menu by clicking the Main Menu button on the Pause screen. We understand you have to stop
	playing sometimes, but you got a really sweet highscore that you don't want to lose. We compromised.
	-Glowing Red cubes (Bombs) now work slightly differently. They will now hurt you very slightly (5 points of damage
	on Normal difficulty), so you'll have to be wiser when using them!
	-Black cubes now cause the screen to flash black if they damage you.
	-Score, healing, shielding, and damage values have been changed for just about every cube. They still follow the 
	basic rules of the cubes, though, which are:
		
		-Greens heal you a little and give you a little score, but hurt you a little if they fall.
		-Blues give you a lot of score, but hurt you a lot if you let them fall.
		-Reds hurt you if you tap them, but they now also reward you for letting them fall by giving you score when
		they fall off the screen.
		-Glowing Red cubes blow up and destroy all cubes around them as though you had touched them. These cubes also
		now reward you with score when you tap on them.
		-All special cubes function the same as they did before, though the shield bonus given by Silver cubes has
		been buffed.

	-You can no longer drag your finger along groups of cubes to destroy them, you must lift your finger after every
	hit, and you can only tap one cube at a time. Yeah, it SOUNDS lame, but trust us, it makes the game much more
	challenging and fun. It was far too easy before.

	In short, we redid the whole game. We re-wrote 95% of the code, redid the organization (slimming the game's files
	down quite a bit), and sought to make everything far neater so that we could add more cool stuff more easily.
	So give it a go and go touch some cubes!
v 2.1
	-Added a confirmation prompt when the user goes to quit the game by pressing the back button on their phone. Helps stop
	the user from accidentally quitting the game during play. That sucks!
	-Added the ability to continue playing the current round after a game over if the user chooses to view an ad.
	-Added multi-launguage support. Supported languages are: English, French, and Spanish.
v 2.2
	-The highest combo of the round is now shown at the Game Over screen
	-The game now saves the number of ads you watched to attain your highscore. This number appears between parentheses after your highscore amount. (A ? means that you 	got the highscore before v2.2)
	-Now if you download the game for the first time, the language will default to your phone's language if it's supported
	-The "Language" button on the Main Menu now looks like Earth
	-Pause the game by tapping with 3 fingers
