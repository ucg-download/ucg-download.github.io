HOW TO CHEAT
------------
Below are listed some cheats, and below that I've listed what they actually do.

To actually be able to type in a cheat, press TAB. This will bring up a blank screen with an input prompt. Type in the below codes (excluding the part before the colon and the space proceeding it).

To exit the input screen, press Enter while your input field is empty.

If the input prompt is playing hide and seek, press Enter and it'll stop hiding.

THE CHEATS
----------
Ghost Blob: I feel... Ectoplasmic.
Random Easter Egg Message: Bunnies lay eggs?
Theme Song Blooper Track: Dang it, Jack!

WHAT THEY DO
------------
Ghost Blob: This causes your blob to become hollow. He's now a ghost blob and cannot take damage. He is super blob. He cannot be defeated. All hail ghost blob.

Random Easter Egg Message: I got bored and typed out 20+ random messages that consist of bad jokes and random thoughts. Typing this code in allows you to see a random one.

Theme Song Blooper Track: We actually wrote and recorded the music for Blob! one evening in probably one of the most frustrating ways to record music: everything in a single take with only one track. Regardless, the song's not too terribly difficult, so we succeeded, but it did take us a few tries. As anyone with audio recording experience knows, this approach means that a single mistake in the course of the recording means everyone has to stop and start all over again.
Anyway, typing the code for this one will play one of the tracks where we didn't succeed in recording it, making several mistakes along the way and a particularly nasty one at the end.
